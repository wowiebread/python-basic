# # create variables for the following :
# # 1. age
# age = 16 #interger variable
# # 2. name
# name = "John" #string variable
# # 3. song
# song = "Happy Birthday" #string variable
# # 4. food
# food = "apples" #string variable
# # 5. number
# number = 100 #interger variable
# print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + "old coder named" + name + ".")
# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
# print(f'''Once upon a time, there was a {age} old coder named {name}.
# {name} liked to hum the song {song} while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would
# throw {food} until {name} would stop singing.
# Still, {name} was the best coder on the team and could write {number} lines of code every day.
# Maybe {song} was {name}â€™s secret power?''')
# # No one will ever know.


# # What is syntax ? What is an algorithm?
# # what is a variable? What is a string?
# #in javascript, we would write a variable like this
# #var name = "John"
# #in python, we would write it like this
# #name = "John"
# #what is a variable? What is a string?
# #variable is a label that we can use to store data

# # strings are nothing but plain text
# # what does this do?
# print("Giraffe \n academy")
# #\n is a newline character

# # or this
# phrase = "python learning"
# print(phrase + "is cool")
# #what does the + sign do? What is it called?


# #what if I wanted to get the length of a phrase?
# print("the length of the string is" + str(len(phrase)))
# declaration = '''We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, ...'''

# #what if I wanted to make the letters in the variable upper case or lower?

#What if I wanted to get one letter of the phrase
name = "welcome to day 2 part 3"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())

phrase2 = "fallout is a great show"
print(phrase2[0])#prints the first letter
print(phrase2[1])#prints the first letter
print(phrase2[5])#prints the first letter
print(phrase2[13])#prints the first letter

#string slicing if I wanted to get entire word
print(phrase2[13:18]) 
print(phrase2[19:24])
print(phrase2[0:7])


print(phrase2[-1]) #prints the last letter or sum

#what if I wanted to check and see if the phrase was all lower or upper?
print(name.islower()) #returns to loolean true or false
print(name.isupper()) #returns to loolean true or false



# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase
# letter eye) as single character variable names.



# Working with numbers bold text
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Addition
print(2 + 2)
# Subtraction
print(2 - 5)
# Multiplication
print(2 * 3)
# Division
print(10 / 2)
# Modulus
print(10 % 3) #prints the remainder of the division
# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3) #2 to the power of 3
# Floor Division
print(10 // 3) # 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1
# Order of Operations followed in Python
print(2 * 3 + 1)
# You can use parentheses to specify the order in which you want operations to be performed.

#to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
#from math import *
#this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
#floor method
#ceil method
#sqrt method
from math import * #import everything
print(floor(95.76666))
print(ceil(98.3333))
print(sqrt(54))


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers. Integers are just whole numbers,
# positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or
# use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of
# floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating
# point number in Python.



# challenge exerces... 
#create a program that asks for the user's name and age and then prints out the user's name and age

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all caps

# create a program that asks for the user's name and then prints out the user's name in all lower case

# create a program that asks for price and then prints out the price with a 10% discount

# Given the phrase "Hancock High School", perform the following operations:
# Print the phrase with a newline character to separate "Hancock" and "High" and "School".
# Concatenate the phrase with " is cool", and print the result.
# Print the length of the phrase.
# Convert and print the phrase in uppercase and lowercase.
# Check if the phrase is all lower or all upper and print the result.
# Print the first and the last letter of the phrase.
